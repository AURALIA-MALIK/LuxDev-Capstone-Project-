# LuxDev-Capstone-Project-
We performed time series modelling on the Craigslist vehicles dataset, which is available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbaabuharun/craigslist-vehicles. This project builds on that work. You will need to download the dataset, copy the data using SQL to a local PostgreSQL database, move the data from your local database to Snowflake, perform data transformation with DBT (data build tool), and use your preferred data visualization tool to create a report and dashboard.
